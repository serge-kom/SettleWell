# SettleWell
Hackathon Project

Project Name: SettleWell

Objective: To provide newly arrived individuals in Canada with a website offering guidance and information to facilitate their settlement and subsequent integration according to their status (refugee, permanent resident, international student, visitor, or temporary worker).

Motivation: The idea of creating the SettleWell website stems from the observation of our own experiences and those of others, noting a lack of orientation for newcomers to Canada. Many arrive without knowing what to do or where to start. Our motivation is to serve the immigrant community by providing them with an online tool that effectively meets their need for orientation and information.

Content: SettleWell website will primarily consist of four main sections: Permanent Resident, International Student, Refugee, and Work Permit. For these four sections, two main types of services will be provided: information on the procedures for each and guidance to facilitate the settlement and integration of immigrant individuals.

Instructions: Users simply need to enter the application name, create an account, and then choose the section of interest to access the desired information.

Design: The design was done in two main stages, using the Figma tool for design and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for coding via APIs and various libraries. It should be noted that the website will be evolving.

(Note: Some minor edits have been made for clarity and readability.)
